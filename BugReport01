# Bug Report: Slow Loading and UI Display Issue in Manage Goals

**ID:** BUG01

2. Navigate to "Manage Goals" tab.  
3. Observe page loading behavior and UI before data appears.

**Expected Result:**  
- Page should load promptly.  
- UI elements should remain stable and aligned while data is loading (use loading placeholders or spinners).

**Actual Result:**  
- Long delay before data is displayed.  
- UI elements show an inconsistent layout with empty gray rectangles in the middle-right area before data loads.
